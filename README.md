# Coursera-iBM-Data-Science-Certificate
This repository will demonstrate my journey to becoming an IBM Certified Data Scientist
I embarked on a real world data science journey with this capstone course and demonstrated proficiency in skills like data collection, data wrangling, and developing machine learning models using Python. I tackled a real-world challenge with my data-driven insights to predict SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landing success.
